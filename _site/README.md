Our team will be utilizing machine learning for the purpose of sentiment analysis on social media posts. Specifically, we will be using a database of over 200,000 reddit posts, which have been labeled for suicidal content, in order to train a machine learning model to recognize suicidal and depressive social media posts. We hope that the advanced detection of severe mental health concerns via the application of such a model can allow for proactive preventative action to be taken in order to protect at-risk individuals from self-harm.
